# Feature Specification: Personal Resume Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a resume website that can be hosted on a static website. Using the following information available in both #file:My Musical Journey.md and my resume information from #file:Resume.md to create the needed single page that will have bookmarks that can scroll to variable sections of the single page site. I would like to have a clean and modern look to the site and also make a light and dark theme switch available on the site so that they can change it. It will also need to be responsive."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Core Resume Viewing (Priority: P1)

A potential employer or professional contact visits Joe's resume website to learn about his professional background, skills, and experience. They need to quickly find specific information about his qualifications, work history, and contact details.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary purpose of the resume website - presenting professional information in an accessible, professional format. Without this core functionality, the site serves no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the website URL and verifying all resume content (qualifications, work history, education) is clearly displayed and readable on desktop and mobile devices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the resume website, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see Joe's name, professional summary, and navigation menu clearly displayed
2. **Given** a user is viewing the resume, **When** they scroll or navigate, **Then** they can access all sections in order: qualifications, education, work history, and musical journey
3. **Given** a user views any section, **When** they read the content, **Then** information is clearly formatted and easy to read

### User Story 2 - Section Navigation (Priority: P2)

A user wants to quickly jump to specific sections of Joe's resume (qualifications, education, work history, musical background) without scrolling through the entire page. They use navigation links that smoothly scroll to the desired section.

**Why this priority**: Navigation enhances user experience by allowing quick access to specific information, making the site more professional and user-friendly.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking navigation links and verifying smooth scrolling to correct sections, with clear visual indication of current section.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sees the navigation menu, **When** they click on a section link (e.g., "Work History"), **Then** the page smoothly scrolls to that section
2. **Given** a user is in any section, **When** they use navigation, **Then** the current section is highlighted in the navigation menu
3. **Given** a user scrolls manually, **When** they enter a new section, **Then** the navigation automatically updates to reflect the current section

### User Story 3 - Theme Customization (Priority: P3)

A user wants to customize their viewing experience by switching between light and dark themes based on their preference or ambient lighting conditions.

**Why this priority**: Theme switching improves accessibility and user comfort, demonstrating attention to user experience and modern web standards.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by toggling the theme switch and verifying all content, colors, and readability are maintained in both light and dark modes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the site, **When** they see the theme toggle control, **Then** they can easily identify and access it
2. **Given** a user clicks the theme toggle, **When** the theme changes, **Then** all content remains readable and visually appealing
3. **Given** a user has selected a theme preference, **When** they revisit the site, **Then** their preference is remembered

---

### User Story 4 - Mobile Experience (Priority: P2)

A user accesses Joe's resume website from their mobile device or tablet and expects the same quality experience as on desktop, with appropriate layout adjustments for smaller screens.

**Why this priority**: Mobile responsiveness is essential for professional websites as many users will access the site from mobile devices.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the site on various device sizes and verifying layout, readability, and functionality remain optimal.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits on a mobile device, **When** the page loads, **Then** content is appropriately sized and readable without horizontal scrolling with bottom tab navigation visible
2. **Given** a user navigates on mobile, **When** they use touch gestures or bottom navigation tabs, **Then** navigation and scrolling work smoothly
3. **Given** a user views any section on mobile, **When** they interact with elements, **Then** all features (bottom navigation, theme toggle) remain accessible

### Edge Cases

- What happens when JavaScript is disabled but theme toggle is clicked?
- How does the site handle extremely long section content that might break layout?
- What occurs when navigation links are accessed while page is still loading?
- How does smooth scrolling behave on very slow devices or connections?
