# Implementation Tasks: Personal Resume Website

**Prerequisites**: Specification and implementation plan completed
**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing

## Task Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **ASP.NET Core Static Site**: `Pages/`, `Views/`, `wwwroot/`, `Models/`, `Services/` at repository root
- **Tests**: `tests/Unit/`, `tests/Integration/`, `tests/Performance/`

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo  
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Core Resume Viewing)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Section Navigation)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Mobile Experience)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Theme Customization)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- **Total Tasks**: 55 tasks (T001-T055)
- **16 parallel tasks** marked with [P] for concurrent execution
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Focus on constitution compliance: static generation, Bootstrap-first, JavaScript minimalism
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards throughout implementation
