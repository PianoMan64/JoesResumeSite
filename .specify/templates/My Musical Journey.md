#My Musical Journey
## Early Beginnings
I have been a long-time musician and singer for many years. My musical journey began at a very young age, around 4 or 5 years old, when I started singing along to a variety of music. My early influences included musicals, Peter, Paul and Mary, the Beatles, and many different genres that shaped my appreciation for music.
By the age of 6, I picked up the acoustic guitar, which marked the beginning of a long list of instruments I would eventually learn to play. After taking acoustic guitar lessons for about a year, I became interested in piano. My family attended a local church with an old upright piano, and I found myself drawn to songs I had heard before. During the Christmas season of my 7th birthday, I started learning how to play Christmas songs on the piano.
Although I had been playing piano for about three years by the time I turned 10, I did not know how to read music. My parents then gave me the opportunity to take piano lessons, and I soon learned to read music, overcoming this initial challenge.
## School Years and Band Experience
When I started sixth grade, I was introduced to concert band. After being tested for compatibility with different instruments, the trombone became my instrument of choice. I continued to play in the concert band throughout middle, junior, and high school. During high school, I was invited to join a select group called “The Stage Band.” This experience allowed me to enhance my skills in playing music by ear, improvise solos, and further develop my singing and piano abilities.
By age 14, I formed my first band with my two younger brothers, my best friend, and a mutual friend. After about a year of dedicated practice and learning our instruments, we began performing small shows for candy money. By my junior year of high school, our band was playing in bars and clubs around Oregon on weekends, earning money to support our music and invest in new equipment.
## Post-High School and Professional Growth
After graduating high school, my middle brother left the band to join the air force. My younger brother and I continued performing with other musical groups in the Longview/Kelso, WA area for about six more years. Eventually, I left the music scene due to marriage and the need for a full-time job that offered better financial stability. Around this time, live music opportunities declined because organizations like ASCAP began enforcing copyright laws more strictly, leading club owners to avoid having bands play copyrighted material. This trend put an end to the live music scene for a long time, only recently seeing a resurgence after more than 20 years.
Florida Years and Return Home to the Northwest
Years later, after being laid off twice from the same job, I had the opportunity to move to Tampa, Florida. There, I joined a group called “Joe Trippy and Fantasy,” a show band comprised of talented musicians performing a wide range of music. Playing with this group was a new experience for me, as I had never worked with such high-caliber musicians before. I performed with them for about two years and worked full time the rest of the time I was there. I collaborate with artists like Frank Sentara Jr. and top acts from the 1950s to the 1990s at the Fountain Blue Hilton in Miami Beach, Florida.
After spending almost eight years in Florida, I moved back to Northwest and now reside in the southwest part of Washington State. Currently, I occasionally participate in “Open Mic” events around town as time permits. In addition to my musical pursuits, I work as a Software Developer and Report Designer for a software company in Vancouver, WA
